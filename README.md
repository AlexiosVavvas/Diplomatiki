# Ergodic Control Navigation

## Project Overview
This repository contains an implementation of ergodic control algorithms for multi-agent robotic systems. Ergodic control is a control strategy that drives agents to match a specified spatial distribution, making it useful for exploration, surveillance, and monitoring applications.

The core concept is to make the time-averaged statistics of an agent's trajectory match a desired spatial distribution, creating an efficient exploration pattern that focuses more time on high-importance regions while still covering the entire space.
